To test out the project on your local machines, you need to install some few npm packages
First initialise npm
install express from npm
install mongoose from npm
install nodemon(to save changes automatically and start the server right away)
make sure you have mongodb running on your machine locally or through their official website
You can download the mongodb on this webiste https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/
Make sure also you have postman or insomnia on your local machine
start the server locally and head over to postman or insomnia to see how the code works
